# 🔐 Web Security Testing with OWASP ZAP

# 📝Overview
This project demonstrates a Password Spraying Attack in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux and Hydra.

Unlike brute force (which tests many passwords against a single account), password spraying tests a few common passwords across many accounts to avoid lockouts. In this exercise, I simulated how an attacker could gain unauthorized access to a Windows share (HR on MS10) by leveraging weak/reused credentials.

This project demonstrates automated vulnerability scanning using [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/). It focuses on detecting and analyzing common web application vulnerabilities:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## 📌 Objectives

- Learn and apply OWASP ZAP for security assessments
- Identify common vulnerabilities in a sample web application
- Generate and interpret automated security reports
